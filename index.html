          A falsy value is the opposite - a value
          considered false when evaluated as a
          boolean. JavaScript has a defined list
          of falsy values. Some of them include
          false, 0, "", null, undefined, and NaN.
        </li>
        <li>
          A truthy value is a value that is
          considered true when evaluated as a
          boolean. Most of the values you
          encounter in JavaScript will be truthy.

          The strict equality operator === is used
          to check if two values are equal and
          share the same type. As a general rule,
          this is the equality operator you should
          always use. With the strict equality
          operator, "0" === 0 becomes false,
          because while they might have the same
          value of zero, they are not of the same
          type.
        </li>
        <li>
          The strict inequality operator !==
          allows you to check if two values are
          not equal, or do not have the same type.
          The syntax is similar to the equality
          operator: value !== 4.
